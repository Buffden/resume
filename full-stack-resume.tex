\section{Professional Experience}

\textbf{Software Engineer, Clarivate Analytics} -- Bangalore, India \hfill \textit{Aug 2023 -- Aug 2024} \\
\begin{highlights}
    \item Designed and evolved scalable Spring Boot REST APIs with versioning, DTO-based contracts, and standardized error handling for long-term growth.
    \item Implemented role-based access control across backend and frontend layers, enforcing subscription-tier and region-based data visibility rules.
    \item Proactively identified performance bottlenecks in reporting services and implemented optimizations across API, database, and caching layers.
    \item Containerized microservices and built deployment pipelines using Docker, Jenkins, and Spinnaker, supporting production releases with zero rollback.
    \item Designed and implemented low-latency typeahead and autocomplete services, improving search responsiveness over large-scale drug datasets.
    \item Architected a highly configurable, reusable Angular table framework supporting filtering, pagination, exports, and user preference persistence, later adopted across multiple internal teams.
    \item Developed dynamic PPT and PDF export pipelines, generating customized reports from charts and tables with custom filters, layouts, and metadata.
    \item Built reusable, aggregation-driven Angular chart components using D3.js, enabling interactive analytics and advanced reporting services.

\textbf{Associate Software Engineer, Clarivate Analytics} -- Bangalore, India \hfill \textit{Aug 2021 -- Jul 2023} \\
\begin{highlights}
    \item Supported continuous production release cycles over two years by deploying containerized services using Jenkins and Spinnaker, ensuring release stability and operational reliability.
    \item Improved frontend performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders and optimizing data-fetching patterns, resulting in ~20\% faster page loads.
    \item Migrated a legacy client-side component to a modern Angular 13 application, contributing to C4-level architectural designs and business components.
    \item Implemented and optimized PostgreSQL schemas, queries, and indexing strategies to improve performance for data-intensive analytical workloads.
    \item Integrated Elasticsearch-backed search capabilities to support fast, advanced queries across large life sciences and drug datasets.
    \item Developed reusable Angular UI components including charts and advanced table views, integrated with Spring Boot APIs for search and reporting.
    \item Implemented secure request-handling mechanisms including JWT-based authentication, CORS/CSRF protection, and input validation standards.
